    <h4><strong><a href="https://github.com/crystalpiroozy2525/CPPLogin">
        C++ Login Authentication Object Oriented Program
    </strong></h4></a>
    <p>Simple login authentication object oriented program in C++. Utilized user input, fstream objects, and dynamic memory allocation. (Jan’23)</p>

        Stormwater Cloud PostgreSQL Database using Python and SQL
    </strong></h4></a>
    <p> Utilized the Entity-Relationship Model (ER-Model) to normalize an existing municipal's stormwater infrastructure database, hosted it as a 
        PostgreSQL database back-end through the Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Relational Database Service (RDS) cloud computing platform and implemented 
        Python and Structured Query Language (SQL) through PostgresSQL psycopg-binary module to develop a front-end Pandas module function to manage and
        display stormwater features. (May’22)</p>
    
    <h4><strong><a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/9118b8f476314812b7496425ad8dcb72">
        Suitability Analysis of Optimal Green Infrastructure (GI) using GIS and R
    </strong></h4></a>
        <p> Assessed the existing stormwater drainage network, hydrological model, and conducted a suitability analysis of optimal green infrastructure (GI) location for stormwater management in Sandy Springs, Georgia. The watershed in Sandy Springs was delineated by extracting data from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using the ArcGIS Pro Hydrology Toolset and the impervious surfaces were calculated for each land parcel by segmenting and classifying the spectral images. The data was managed and visualized through a time series analysis and regression model using ggplot2 packages in R. Lasly, a Suitability Analysis model was utilized to conduct a multi-criteria decision and integrated analysis of the optimal GI locations through the Weighted Sum function. (May’21)</p>

            Analyzing PFOA + PFOS State Funded Sites using the Python Pandas package 
        </strong></h4></a>
            <p>Created a function in Python to allow the user input function to calculate State Funded Sites monitoring well's PFOA + PFOS levels, to exhibit their Health Advisory Levels (HAL), and to manage spatial data in csv files and dataframes with Pandas. Chained conditionals, such as if and else statements were generated to identify one type of sensitive receptor (hospitals) within a one mile radius of identified PFAS contaminated sites using spatial data in Northeast Florida. The results were visualized through a map produced by the Folium module.(Dec’20)</p>
